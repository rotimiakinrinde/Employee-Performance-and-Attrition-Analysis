## Key Questions Addressed

### Descriptive Analytics
The following metrics were analyzed to provide an overview of employee demographics and distribution from the employee performance and employee test tables:

The dataset comprises 1,470 employees, with the maximum length of service being 31 years. This indicates a mix of experienced and newer employees. 
The highest number of employees work in the Sales and Marketing department (446), followed by Research & Development (291) while the Human Resources department has the fewest employees (63).

The analysis identifies, 72.7% of employees are male (1,069 employees), while 27.3% are female (401 employees). This highlights a gender imbalance.
The majority of employees (51%) are aged 30-39 (749 employees), while only 7 employees are aged 60 and above. Employees aged 20-29 make up 25% of the workforce. 
The analysis further shows that the most represented age group is 30-39, while the least represented is 60+. This suggests opportunities for intergenerational knowledge-sharing and mentorship.

### Diagnostic Analytics
These analysis metrics delve deeper into performance and attrition:

This analysis illustrates an average training score of 97, with Employees in Research & Development having the highest average training scores, while employees in Human Resources lag.
The analysis further shows that the overall attrition rate is 16%, with the Sales department having the highest attrition (73). Regions with higher attrition include Region C, which indicates challenges with employee retention in certain areas.

The analysis also indicates employees in Research & Development report the highest satisfaction levels (average of 4.2), while the Sales department has the lowest (average of 3.1).

Furthermore, employees attending more training sessions (5+) have a 20% higher average performance rating than those with fewer training sessions. This further indicates the importance of internal training for the employees.

* Address job dissatisfaction in departments with low scores.

### Conclusion

The analysis reveals significant insights into employee demographics, performance, and attrition trends at Emerald Technologies. Key findings include a high concentration of employees in the 30-39 age group, gender imbalances, and varying satisfaction levels across departments. Attrition challenges are pronounced in the Sales department and Region C, while Research & Development excels in both training scores and job satisfaction.

By implementing targeted strategies such as enhanced training programs and diversity initiatives Emerald Technologies can improve employee retention and productivity. These data-driven insights serve as a foundation for building a more inclusive, efficient, and motivated workforce.
