The analysis identifies, 72.7% of employees are male (1,069 employees), while 27.3% are female (401 employees). This highlights a gender imbalance.
The majority of employees (51%) are aged 30-39 (749 employees), while only 7 employees are aged 60 and above. Employees aged 20-29 make up 25% of the workforce. 
The analysis further shows that the most represented age group is 30-39, while the least represented is 60+. This suggests opportunities for intergenerational knowledge-sharing and mentorship programs.

* How do training attendance and scores impact performance ratings?

* What regions and departments have the highest attrition rates?

* Which departments and regions report the highest job satisfaction?


### Recommendations

**Attrition Mitigation:**

* Implement targeted retention strategies in regions and departments with high attrition.

**Training Optimization:**

* Increase training frequency in low-performing departments.

* Introduce tailored training programs based on job levels and age groups.

**Promotion and Satisfaction:**

* Use performance metrics to develop fair appraisal and promotion policies.
